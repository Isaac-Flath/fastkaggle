## Install

Either:

    pip install fastkaggle

or:

    mamba install -c fastai fastkaggle

(or replace `mamba` with `conda` if you don’t mind it taking much longer
to run…)

## How to use

This little library is where I’ll be putting snippets of stuff which are
useful on Kaggle. Functionality includes the following:

It defines
[iskaggle](https://fastai.github.io/fastkaggle/core.html#iskaggle) which
is `True` if you’re running on Kaggle:

``` python
'Kaggle' if iskaggle else 'Not Kaggle'
```

    'Not Kaggle'

It provides a
[setup_comp](https://fastai.github.io/fastkaggle/core.html#setup_comp)
function which gets a path to the data for a competition, downloading it
if needed, and also installs any modules that might be missing or out of
data if running on Kaggle:

``` python
setup_comp('titanic')
```

    Path('titanic')

There’s also
[push_notebook](https://fastai.github.io/fastkaggle/core.html#push_notebook)
to push a notebook to Kaggle Notebooks, and
[import_kaggle](https://fastai.github.io/fastkaggle/core.html#import_kaggle)
to use the Kaggle API (even when you’re on Kaggle!) See the
`fastkaggle.core` docs for details.
